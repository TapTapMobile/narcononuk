<li><span class="privacy-lead-in">CONFIDENTIALITY OF HEALTH INFORMATION.</span> Health information which we receive and/or create  about you, personally, in this programme, relating to your past, present, or future health, treatment, or payment for health care services, is âsensitive personal dataâ under Data Protection Laws. The confidentiality of drug and alcohol abuse student records maintained by this programme is protected. Generally, the programme may not say to a person outside the programme that you attend the programme, or disclose any information identifying you as an alcohol or drug abuser, or use or disclose any other sensitive personal data except in limited circumstances as permitted by law.
    
</li><li><span class="privacy-lead-in">THE CENTREâS PLEDGE REGARDING HEALTH
INFORMATION.</span> The Centre understands that health information about you and your health is personal. The Centre is committed to protecting health information about you. In order to provide you with quality service and to comply with legal requirements, the Centre creates a record of the services you receive at the Centre. This Notice of Privacy Practices &amp; Confidentiality of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Student Records (the âNoticeâ) applies to all of the records of your service generated by the Centre. This Notice will tell you about the ways in which the Centre may use and disclose sensitive personal data about you. It also describes your rights and certain obligations the Centre has regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive personal data. The Centre is required by law to make sure that health information that identifies you is kept private. 
    
</li><li><span class="privacy-lead-in">WHO IS BOUND BY THE NOTICE.</span> This Notice describes the Centreâs practices and those of Centre staff, volunteers, and other personnel who are involved in your services. The Centre and these individuals will follow the terms of this Notice, and may use or disclose health information about you as permitted or required by law.

</li><li><span class="privacy-lead-in">HOW THE CENTRE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE
HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT&nbsp;YOU.</span> The Centre collects health information about you and stores it in a chart, on a computer, and in a personal health record. This is your medical record. The medical record is the property of the Centre, but the information in the medical record belongs to you. The following categories describe different ways that the Centre may use or disclose health information. For each category of uses and disclosures, the Centre will explain what is meant and may give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways the Centre is permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories.

For example: Two or more providers within the programme may consult with each other regarding your best course of treatment. The programme may share your health information in order to receive payment for health care services rendered to you. And/or, your health information may be discussed within the programme about your treatment in connection with others in the programme, in an effort to improve the overall quality of care provided by our programme.

Examples of qualified service organizations and/or business associates include billing companies, data processing companies, or companies that provide administrative or speciality services. To protect your health information, we require these qualified service organizations and/or business associates to follow the same standards held by this programme through terms detailed in a written agreement.
