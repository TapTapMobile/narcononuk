The confidentiality of drug and alcohol abuse student records maintained by this programme is protected. Generally, the programme may not say to a person outside the programme that you attend the programme, or disclose any information identifying you as an alcohol or drug abuser, or use or disclose any other sensitive personal data except in limited circumstances as permitted by law.
    
</li><li><span class="privacy-lead-in">THE CENTRE’S PLEDGE REGARDING HEALTH

This Notice of Privacy Practices &amp; Confidentiality of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Student Records (the “Notice”) applies to all of the records of your service generated by the Centre. This Notice will tell you about the ways in which the Centre may use and disclose sensitive personal data about you.

</li><li><span class="privacy-lead-in">HOW THE CENTRE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE
HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT&nbsp;YOU.</span> The Centre collects health information about you and stores it in a chart, on a computer, and in a personal health record. This is your medical record. The medical record is the property of the Centre, but the information in the medical record belongs to you. The following categories describe different ways that the Centre may use or disclose health information. For each category of uses and disclosures, the Centre will explain what is meant and may give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed.
